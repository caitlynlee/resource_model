#### Running the GUI

Open Psychopy (Command-Space and then type psychopy). Once you have opened Psychopy, click File-Open and then find "run.py" (it will be in Desktop under the folder that you downloaded).

Update the subject ID and then click run. 

When the participant doesn't grip up to the threshold (during the GO portion), hit the space bar. It will go through one more "STOP" portion and then show a "+" sign afterwards. 

It will then go through the other set of instructions and then go through the grip trial again. As above, then why don't hit the threshold, hit the space bar again. 

Wait and then they will go through the third trial. When they don't meet the threshold, hit the space bar and wait again. When the participant is shown an "END" screen, the experiment is over and psychopy will close on its own. IF it closes BEFORE you saw the "END" at any point, it crashed. Follow the basic troubleshooting directions below. 



#### Basic troubleshooting

 - If NeuLog crashes or freezes, Command-Q out of it and also close Chromium (blue-ish chrome icon)
 - If psychopy crashes, click Ignore and then retry
